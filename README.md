# Toxic-Comment-Filtration
ToxGuard is a full-stack web app that detects and filters toxic comments in real time. Users submit text through a React interface, and a Node.js backend analyzes it using an AI toxicity model. Results are stored in MongoDB and reviewed through an admin dashboard, helping maintain safe and respectful online communication.
